## My First Hackathon Experience at Royal Hackaway

On January 21, 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in my first hackathon, Royal Hackaway, an MLH Hackathon hosted by my university. This event was not just a test of my technical skills but also a chance to collaborate with people like (faisalmujawar148 on github), innovate, and push the boundaries of what I thought was possible within a limited timeframe.

### The Event

Royal Hackaway brought together students from various disciplines, all eager to create something amazing over the course of 24 hours. The atmosphere was electric with creativity and the spirit of competition. The hackathon kicked off with an opening ceremony where we were introduced to the event's rules, resources.

### The Project: CVision - AI cv Assistant

For the hackathon, my teammate and I decided to work on a project that we named **CVision - AI cv Assistant**. Despite facing the challenge of high level competitivity , we were determined to see our project through to completion.

I recently had the chance to work on a project that completely pushed my limits—and it turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my coding journey. Introducing CVision—an AI-powered CV scrapper built with Flask, JavaScript, and TypeScript. This project was my deep dive into the world of backend APIs, AI integration, and modern web development, all under the ticking clock of a hackathon.

The Spark
It all started with a simple idea: streamline the recruitment process by letting AI do the heavy lifting. I wanted to create a tool that could quickly extract key information from resumes, saving recruiters countless hours. With that vision in mind, I set up my development environment and got straight to work.

The Journey
The process was anything but straightforward:

Brainstorming & Setup: I kicked things off with a flurry of brainstorming sessions. Deciding on the features and overall flow was both exciting and nerve-wracking. Once I had a solid plan, it was time to set up the environment and start coding.
Building with Flask and APIs: Diving into Flask was a game changer. I integrated various APIs to bring in AI functionalities, which allowed the system to analyze resumes and pull out important details. This part of the project really tested my ability to juggle backend logic with real-time data processing.
Front End with JavaScript & TypeScript: On the front end, I leaned on JavaScript and TypeScript to create a user-friendly interface. My goal was to ensure that the experience was not just functional but also intuitive and visually appealing.
Overcoming Hurdles: The hackathon environment meant that challenges were part of the package. I had to learn quickly—whether it was refining my git skills, debugging tricky integration issues, or optimizing the AI models. There were moments when the pressure was intense, but each obstacle was a stepping stone that taught me something new.
The Outcome
By the end of the hackathon, I had a working prototype of CVision. It wasn’t perfect, but it was a solid start. The project demonstrated how AI could transform a routine task like resume screening into something much more efficient and insightful.

Reflections
This hackathon was more than just a coding challenge—it was a personal growth experience. I learned so much about using Flask for backend development, the intricacies of API importing, and the dynamic nature of modern JavaScript and TypeScript frameworks. Most importantly, I realized that every challenge, whether technical or time-related, was an opportunity to enhance my skills and push my boundaries.

You can check out the project on GitHub or read more about the experience on my blog post.

Looking back, I’m grateful for every moment of this journey. The ups and downs not only helped me build a cool project but also deepened my passion for backend development and AI. Here’s to more learning, more coding, and more breakthroughs in the future!

Happy coding!
